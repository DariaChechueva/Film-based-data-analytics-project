Gender Dynamics in European Cinema (2014–2019)

This project explores gender dynamics among directors in European cinema during the period 2014–2019. 

Dataset Description

The foundational dataset was derived from the LUMIERE database (https://lumiere.obs.coe.int/), which includes detailed records of films produced in Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2019. These countries were selected to ensure continuity with prior research and to capture regional diversity in European cinema.
The combined dataset for these countries and years is available in the file named lumiere.xlsx.

To conduct the analysis, additional attributes were incorporated from the IMDb datasets, specifically from the following files:
title.basics.tsv: Contains information about film titles and basic attributes.
name.basics.tsv: Includes details on individuals involved in film production.
title.crew.tsv: Links the two previous files together.
Due to the large file sizes of these IMDb datasets, they are not included in this repository. However, they can be downloaded directly from the IMDb dataset repository using the link: https://datasets.imdbws.com/.

This repository is designed for researchers and analysts interested in studying gender representation in the European film industry.
